  comment       = {Let r$\geq$2 be an integer. E. Borel defined a $\xi \in$R to be normal to base r if in its r- adic expansion every block of digits of length k appears with asymptotic frequency 1/rk. The question how normality to different bases is related has been studied by a number of authors. If $\xi$ is normal to a base r then it is normal to any base r$\prime$ which is multiplicatively dependent (i.e., r$\prime$ is a rational power of r). However, W. M. Schmidt [Acta Arith. 7 (1961/1962), 299--309; MR0140482] proved the following result: Let B be a set of bases which is closed under multiplicative dependence; then there are real numbers normal to every base in B and not normal to any base in its complement.
In the present paper the authors study this question by means of mathematical logic and descriptive set theory. Their first main result is the following: let M be the set of minimal representatives of the equivalence classes for multiplicative dependence. Then forany{{$\Pi$}}03 subsetRofM,thereisacomputable$\xi$$\in$Rsuchthatforallr$\in$M,r$\in$R if and only if $\xi$ is normal to base r. Furthermore, $\xi$ is computable uniformly in the {{$\Pi$}}03 formula defining R.
Relying on this theorem they show that the set of indices for computable real numbers which are normal to at least one base is {{$\Sigma$}}04-complete and that the set of real numbers that are normal to at least one base is {{$\Sigma$}}04-complete. This confirms a conjecture by A. Ditzen [see H. Ki and T. Linton, Fund. Math. 144 (1994), no. 2, 163--179; MR1273694].
Applying the Kleene Fixed Point Theorem they deduce that for any {{$\Pi$}}03 formula $\phi$ there is a computable $\xi$ $\in$ R such that for any base r $\in$ M , $\phi$($\xi$, r) is true if and only if $\xi$ is normal to base r.
It is well known that $\xi$ is normal to base r if and only if the sequence (rn$\xi$)n$\geq$1 is uniformly distributed modulo 1. This in turn is equivalent to the relation limN$\rightarrow$$\infty$DN(rn$\xi$)=0whereDN denotesthediscrepancy
    1  N     DN(rn$\xi$)= sup  N c[u,v)({rj$\xi$})$-$(v$-$u) .
0$\leq$u<v$\leq$1   j=1
(Here c[u,v) is the characteristic function of the interval [u,v) and {rj$\xi$} the fractional part of rj$\xi$.) Regarding these the authors prove the following result: Let s be a fixed base. There is a computable function f : N $\rightarrow$ Q monotonically decreasing to 0 such that for any function g: N $\rightarrow$ Q monotonically decreasing to 0, there is a $\xi$ $\in$ R which is normal to all bases, whose discrepancy for base s eventually dominates g, and whose discrepancy for every base multiplicatively independent to s is eventually dominated by f. Furthermore, $\xi$ is computable from g.
Finally, the authors establish the following strengthening of Schmidt{\textquoteright}s theorem men- tioned above: Let R be a set of bases closed under multiplicative dependence. Then there are real numbers which are normal to every base in R and which are not sim- ply normal to any base in its complement (i.e., the defining property for normality is not even satisfied for digits). Furthermore, such a number can be obtained computably from R.

  abstract      = {Let Z[$\sqrt{}$D] be a quadratic extension of the ring Z of rational integers. A k-ary relation R(y1,$\cdots$,yk) over Z[$\sqrt{}$D] is said to be Diophantine if there is a polynomial P in Z[y1,$\cdots$,yk,x1,$\cdots$,xn] such that R(y1,$\cdots$,yk) holds if and only if there exist numbers x1,$\cdots$,xn in Z[$\sqrt{}$D] such that P(y1,$\cdots$,yk,x1,$\cdots$,xn)=0. The author proves that a k-ary relation is Diophantine over Z[$\sqrt{}$D] if and only if it is recursively enumerable and invariant under the automorphism $\sqrt{}$D$\rightarrow$$-$$\sqrt{}$D (conjugation). In particular, he proves that the solvability of polynomial equations over Z[$\sqrt{}$D] is effectively undecidable.
   The author considers separately the cases in which D is positive and negative. In each case he gives a simple set of Diophantine equations in the variables (t,u1,$\cdots$,up) all of whose solutions in Z[$\sqrt{}$D] involve rational integral values for t; moreover, the positive values of t that arise include all squares of natural numbers. Since every natural number is the sum of at most four squares of natural numbers, the relation x$\in$N is Diophantine over Z[$\sqrt{}$D]. Consequently, the author's problem is equivalent to Hilbert's tenth problem, since every Diophantine relation over Z[$\sqrt{}$D] is invariant under conjugation.

Amer. Math. Soc. 48 (1975), 214--220; MR0360513]. In the present paper, the authors extend the method to find some more number fields for which the conjecture is true (obtaining the above result as a special case). The conjecture is true if [L:Q]=4, L is not totally real, and L contains a quadratic subfield; or if L is not totally real, and is of degree 2 over a totally real subfield for which the conjecture is true. The first author promises to prove in a subsequent paper that the conjecture is true for every totally real number field, and hence, by the above, also for any quadratic extension of a totally real number field.},

  abstract  = {In these lecture notes we give sketches of classical undecidability results in number theory, like G{\"o}del's first Incompleteness Theorem (that the first order theory of the integers in the language of rings is undecidable), Julia Robinson's extensions of this result to arbitrary number fields and rings of integers in them, as well as to the ring of totally real integers, and Matiyasevich's negative solution of Hilbert's 10th problem, i.e., the undecidability of the existential first-order theory of the integers. As Hilbert's 10th problem is still open for the rationals (i.e., the question whether the existential theory of the field of rational numbers is decidable) we also present a sketch of the fact that there is a universal definition of the ring of integers inside the field of rationals. In terms of complexity this is the simplest definition known so far. If one had an existential definition instead then Hilbert's 10th problem over the rationals would reduce to that over the integers (and hence be, as expected, unsolvable), but, modulo a widely believed in conjecture in number theory, we also indicate why there should be no such existential definition. We conclude with a list of nice open questions in the area.},

  abstract  = {At the 1900 International Congress of Mathematicians, held that year in Paris, the German mathematician David Hilbert put forth a list of 23 unsolved problems that he saw as being the greatest challenges for twentieth-century mathematics. Hilbert's 10th problem, to find a method (what we now call an algorithm) for deciding whether a Diophantine equation has an integral solution, was solved by Yuri Matiyasevich in 1970. Proving the undecidability of Hilbert's 10thproblem is clearly one of the great mathematical results of the century.This book presents the full, self-contained negative solution of Hilbert's 10th problem. In addition it contains a number ofdiverse, often striking applications of the technique developed for that solution (scattered previously in journals), describes the many improvements and modifications of the original proof -since the problem was "unsolved" 20 years ago, and adds several new, previously unpublished proofs. Included are numerous exercises that range in difficulty from the elementary to small research problems, open questions, and unsolved problems. Each chapter concludes with a commentary providing a historical view of its contents. And an extensive bibliography contains references to all of the main publications directed to the negative solution of Hilbert's 10th problem as well as the majority of the publications dealing with applications of the solution. Intended for young mathematicians, Hilbert's 10th Problem requires only a modest mathematical background. A few less well known number-theoretical results are presented in the appendixes. No knowledge of recursion theory is presupposed. All necessary notions are introduced and defined in the book, making it suitable for the first acquaintance with this fascinating subject. Yuri Matiyasevich is Head of the Laboratory of Mathematical Logic, Steklov Institute of Mathematics, Russian Academy of Sciences, Saint Petersburg.},

  abstract      = {A set of n-tuples of a ring R is called Diophantine over R if it is of the form {x∈Rn:(∃y∈Rm)p(x,y)=0} for a polynomial p in R[x,y]. J. Denef and L. Lipshitz [J. London Math. Soc. (2) 18 (1978), no. 3, 385–391; MR0518221] conjectured that for every field K that is a finite extension of Q, the set Z is Diophantine over OK, where OK is the ring of integers of the field K. In the above-cited paper as well as in a number of papers of Denef, the validity of this conjecture for some special cases was proved, among them for quadratic extensions of Q [see, e.g., Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 48 (1975), 214–220; MR0360513].
   In the present paper, using the methods of Denef [Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 257 (1980), no. 1, 227–236; MR0549163] the author proves this conjecture for finite extensions of Q of degree ≥3 with exactly two nonreal embeddings into C. (An example of such a field is Q(d), where d3 is a rational number without rational cubic roots.)
   The result, together with Matiyasevich's theorem that recursively enumerable subsets of Z are Diophantine, gives the undecidability of Hilbert's tenth problem for rings of integers of such fields.

Hilbert gave finding such an algorithm as problem number ten on a list he presented at an international congress of mathematicians in 1900. Thus the problem, which has become known as Hilbert's Tenth Problem, was shown to be unsolvable. This book presents an account of results extending Hilbert's Tenth Problem to integrally closed subrings of global fields including, in the function field case, the fields themselves. While written from the point of view of Algebraic Number Theory, the book includes chapters on Mazur's conjectures on topology of rational points and Poonen's elliptic curve method for constructing a Diophatine model of rational integers over a 'very large' subring of the field of rational numbers.},

  abstract  = {Number theory as studied by the logician is the subject matter of the book. This first volume can stand on its own as a somewhat unorthodox introduction to mathematical logic for undergraduates, dealing with the usual introductory material: recursion theory, first-order logic, completeness, incompleteness, and undecidability. In addition, its second chapter contains the most complete logical discussion of Diophantine Decision Problems available anywhere, taking the reader right up to the frontiers of research (yet remaining accessible to the undergraduate). The first and third chapters also offer greater depth and breadth in logico-arithmetical matters than can be found in existing logic texts. Each chapter contains numerous exercises, historical and other comments aimed at developing the student's perspective on the subject, and a partially annotated bibliography.},
